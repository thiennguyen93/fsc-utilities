I am Thien Nguyen, but people often call me 'Thien'. At present, I am a web developer at HPT Vietnam Corporation.
I love anything related to programming and web/app development. That is the reason why my career goal is to become a full-stack developer. I am a kind of person who is quick to pick up new skills and willing to learn from the others. Therefore, I am interested in joining innovative teams to learn, to contribute and to improve myself.

Sometimes I really do not know who I am or for what I live, the life is still going with full of ups and downs and I just do what I want
