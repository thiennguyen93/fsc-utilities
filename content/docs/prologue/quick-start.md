- A mileage profile (or profile in short) is used to store a set of mileages and the application do not have the limitation on the number of profiles that can be created. 
- Each profile contains a set of mileages (06 drivers, extra 02 presets and a minimum mileage). Each one couples together a pair of values, which is one-way 
miles and annual mileage
